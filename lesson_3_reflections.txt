Q1 : When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Answer : When we require to share our project, and if multiple people are working on same project then it is better to keep it in remote repositary.

Q2 : Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Answer : We may not want to be in sync with remote repositary sometimes. It depends on what feature or bug we are working on but before pushing the changes it is better to update local repositary.

Q3 : Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Answer : Forks - It means to download/copy other project to own github account. It can be used when we want make changes on other projects and use them and also want to maintain git repositary.
Clones - Cloning the project means downloading project from given url to our own machine. It is local repositary to our system. we can make changes to our local system and commit changes and at last if it is done, we can push the changes to remote.
Branches : We create branch of a project generally when we want to continue our work on project as well as we want to use it. Other example can be two different versions of a project like easy-hard.
